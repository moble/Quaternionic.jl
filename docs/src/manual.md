# Quaternionic functions

## Constructors and Number methods

At the most basic level, `Quaternion{T}` mimics `Complex{T}` as closely as possible, including the
behavior of most functions in `Base`.

To create new `Quaternion`s interactively, it is typically most convenient to
use the constants `imx`, `imy`, and `imz` ‚Äî or equivalently `ùê¢`, `ùê£`, and `ùê§` ‚Äî
multiplied by appropriate factors and added together.  For programmatic work,
it is more common to use the [`Quaternion`](@ref) function ‚Äî which takes all
four components, the three vector components, or just the one scalar component,
and creates a new `Quaternion` of the type implied by the arguments.  You can
also *specify* the type, as in `Quaternion{Float64}(...)`.  Type conversions
with `promote`, `widen`, `float`, etc., work as expected.  The standard
[`Number`
functions](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/numbers/#General-Number-Functions-and-Constants)
that work for `Complex`, such as `isfinite`, `iszero`, etc., should work
analogously for `Quaternion`.  The `hash`, `read`, and `write` functions are
also implemented.  As noted in the [Examples](@ref), broadcasting to each
component is also implemented via `broadcasted`.

## Algebra and mathematical functions

Along with the basic binary operators, the essential mathematical functions
like [`conj`](@ref), [`abs`](@ref), [`abs2`](@ref), [`exp`](@ref),
[`log`](@ref), etc., are implemented.  Most of these functions are found in the
`Base` module, and are simply overloaded methods of functions that should also
be familiar from `Complex` types.  Note that we use a slightly different
interpretation of [`angle`](@ref) for `Quaternion`, compared to `Complex`.  We
also have [`absvec`](@ref) and [`abs2vec`](@ref), which are not useful in a
`Complex` context, but compute the relevant quantities for the "vector"
component of a `Quaternion`.

## Random quaternions

It is frequently convenient to construct random `Quaternion` objects, which can
be done just as with other types by passing the desired output type to the
[`randn`](@ref) function.  The `rand` function is not overloaded, because there
would be no geometric significance to such a `Quaternion`; `randn` results are
independent of the orientation of the basis used to define the quaternions.  A
simple convenience function [`randn_rotor`](@ref) is also provided, to
normalize each result.

## Conversions

It can sometimes be useful to convert between quaternions and other
representations.  Most of these functions are named `to_<representation>` and
have a corresponding `from_<representation>` function.  Furthermore, most
convert to/from representations of rotations.  While rotations are not the only
useful application of quaternions, they are probably the most common.  The only
conversions that are not specifically related to rotations are
[`to_float_array`](@ref) and [`from_float_array`](@ref).

## Distances

There are several ways of measuring the "distance" between two quaternions:
``d(q_1, q_2)``.  Fundamentally, any comparison between two quaternions ``q_1``
and ``q_2`` must make use of a binary operation, for which there are two
obvious choices: addition or multiplication.  For either choice, we operate on
``q_1`` and the appropriate inverse (either additive or multiplicative) of
``q_2``.  That is, ``d`` should be a function of either ``q_1 - q_2`` or
``q_1/q_2``.[^1]

[^1]:
    For ``q_1/q_2``, we are dealing with the *multiplicative* group of
    quaternions, which does not include 0, so we will assume that no quaternion
    involved in such a function can be 0.

Now, we also have a number of criteria we would like any distance function to
satisfy.  For any quaternions ``q_1`` and ``q_2`` and any *unit* quaternion
``q_3``, we require

  * real-valued: ``d(q_1, q_2) \in \mathbb{R}``
  * symmetry: ``d(q_1, q_2) = d(q_2, q_1)``
  * invariance: ``d(q_3\, q_1, q_3\, q_2) = d(q_1, q_2) = d(q_1\, q_3, q_2\, q_3)``
  * identity: ``d(q_1, q_1) = 0``
  * positive-definiteness: ``d(q_1, q_2) > 0`` whenever ``q_1 ‚â† q_2``

(Of course, it should be noted that these criteria all hold in the *exact*
case; when using floating-point numbers, will likely be violated near edge
cases.)

It is not hard to see that these criteria can be satisfied by any of

  * `abs2(q‚ÇÅ - q‚ÇÇ)`
  * `abs(q‚ÇÅ - q‚ÇÇ)`
  * `abs2(log(q‚ÇÅ / q‚ÇÇ)`
  * `abs(log(q‚ÇÅ / q‚ÇÇ))`

If ``q_1`` and ``q_2`` are interpreted as rotations, we frequently don't care
about their signs, and just want the *smallest* distance between them, for any
choice of sign.  Furthermore, in the multiplicative case, the `log` functions
will involve calculation of the `log` of the magnitudes of the quaternions,
which should be 1.  In this case, we relax the "positive-definiteness"
criterion to allow ``d(q_1, q_2)`` to equal zero when ``q_1`` and ``q_2`` are
related by a nonzero scalar multiple.

While these functions are simple to implement as needed, it is also useful to
have a single function to remind us of all the possibilities.  The
[`distance`](@ref) function implements all these possible choices with keyword
arguments.  The [`distance_rotation`](@ref) function is similar, but restricts
to the multiplicative case, and assumes rotations.  These two functions, with
their default arguments, are likely to be the most commonly needed functions.
