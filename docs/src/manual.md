# Quaternionic functions

From `AbstractQuaternion{T}` we define three subtypes:

  * `Quaternion{T}`, which is an element of the general algebra of quaternions
    over any `T<:Real`.
  * `Rotor{T}`, which is an element of the multiplicative group of unit
    quaternions, and is interpreted as mapping to a rotation.  The magnitude is
    *assumed* to be 1 (though, for efficiency, this is not generally
    confirmed), and the sign may be freely changed in certain cases.
  * `QuatVec{T}`, which is an element of the additive group of quaternions with
    0 scalar part; a "pure vector" quaternion.

For simplicity, almost every function in this package is defined for general
`Quaternion`s, so you may not need any other type.  However, it can frequently
be more accurate *and* more efficient to use the other subtypes where relevant.

## Constructors, constants, and conversions

At the most basic level, `Quaternion{T}` mimics `Complex{T}` as closely as
possible, including the behavior of most functions in `Base`.  The `Rotor{T}`
and `QuatVec{T}` subtypes behave very similarly, except that most of their
constructors automatically impose the constraints that the norm is 1 and the
scalar component is 0, respectively.  Also note that when a certain operation
is not defined for either of those subtypes, the functions will usually convert
to a general `Quaternion` automatically.

To create new `Quaternion`s interactively, it is typically most convenient to
use the constants `imx`, `imy`, and `imz` ‚Äî or equivalently `ùê¢`, `ùê£`, and `ùê§` ‚Äî
multiplied by appropriate factors and added together.  For programmatic work,
it is more common to use the [`Quaternion`](@ref) function ‚Äî which takes all
four components, the three vector components, or just the one scalar component,
and creates a new `Quaternion` of the type implied by the arguments.  You can
also *specify* the type, as in `Quaternion{Float64}(...)`.  Type conversions
with `promote`, `widen`, `float`, etc., work as expected.

## Number functions from Base

The standard [`Number`
functions](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/numbers/#General-Number-Functions-and-Constants)
that work for `Complex`, such as `isfinite`, `iszero`, etc., should work
analogously for `Quaternion`.  The `hash`, `read`, and `write` functions are
also implemented.  As noted in the [Examples](@ref), broadcasting to each
component is also implemented via `broadcasted`.

## Algebra and mathematical functions

Along with the basic binary operators, the essential mathematical functions
like [`conj`](@ref), [`abs`](@ref), [`abs2`](@ref), [`exp`](@ref),
[`log`](@ref), etc., are implemented.  Most of these functions are found in the
`Base` module, and are simply overloaded methods of functions that should also
be familiar from `Complex` types.  Note that we use a slightly different
interpretation of [`angle`](@ref) for `Quaternion`, compared to `Complex`.  We
also have [`absvec`](@ref) and [`abs2vec`](@ref), which are not useful in a
`Complex` context, but compute the relevant quantities for the "vector"
component of a `Quaternion`.

```


## Random quaternions

It is frequently convenient to construct random `Quaternion` objects, which can
be done just as with other types by passing the desired output type to the
[`randn`](@ref) function.  The `rand` function is not overloaded, because there
would be no geometric significance to such a `Quaternion`; `randn` results are
independent of the orientation of the basis used to define the quaternions.
Note that it is possible to get random *rotors* and *vectors* by passing the
appropriate tyepes to the `randn` function.

```


## Conversions

It can sometimes be useful to convert between quaternions and other
representations.  Most of these functions are named `to_<representation>` and
have a corresponding `from_<representation>` function.  Furthermore, most
convert to/from representations of rotations.  While rotations are not the only
useful application of quaternions, they are probably the most common.  The only
conversions that are not specifically related to rotations are
[`to_float_array`](@ref) and [`from_float_array`](@ref).

```


## Distances

There are several ways of measuring the "distance" between two quaternions:
``d(q_1, q_2)``.  Fundamentally, any comparison between two quaternions ``q_1``
and ``q_2`` must make use of a binary operation, for which there are two
obvious choices: addition or multiplication.  For either choice, we operate on
``q_1`` and the appropriate inverse (either additive or multiplicative) of
``q_2``.  That is, ``d`` should be a function of either ``q_1 - q_2`` or
``q_1/q_2``.[^1]

[^1]:
    For ``q_1/q_2``, we are dealing with the *multiplicative* group of
    quaternions, which does not include 0, so we will assume that no quaternion
    involved in such a function can be 0.

Now, we also have a number of criteria we would like any distance function to
satisfy.  For any quaternions ``q_1`` and ``q_2`` and any *unit* quaternion
``q_3``, we require

  * real-valued: ``d(q_1, q_2) \in \mathbb{R}``
  * symmetry: ``d(q_1, q_2) = d(q_2, q_1)``
  * invariance: ``d(q_3\, q_1, q_3\, q_2) = d(q_1, q_2) = d(q_1\, q_3, q_2\, q_3)``
  * identity: ``d(q_1, q_1) = 0``
  * positive-definiteness: ``d(q_1, q_2) > 0`` whenever ``q_1 ‚â† q_2``

(Of course, it should be noted that these criteria all hold in the *exact*
case; when using floating-point numbers, will likely be violated near edge
cases.)

It is not hard to see that these criteria can be satisfied by any of

  * `abs(q‚ÇÅ - q‚ÇÇ)`
  * `abs2(q‚ÇÅ - q‚ÇÇ)`
  * `abs(log(q‚ÇÅ / q‚ÇÇ))`
  * `abs2(log(q‚ÇÅ / q‚ÇÇ)`

If ``q_1`` and ``q_2`` are interpreted as rotations, we frequently don't care
about their signs, and just want the *smallest* distance between them, for any
choice of sign.  Furthermore, in the multiplicative case, the `log` functions
will involve calculation of the `log` of the magnitudes of the quaternions,
which should be 1.  In this case, we relax the "positive-definiteness"
criterion to allow ``d(q_1, q_2)`` to equal zero when ``q_1`` and ``q_2`` are
related by a nonzero scalar multiple.

For `Rotor` types, the latter two multiplicative options are most relevant, while for
other types the additive options are more relevant.  These are the default
behaviors of the `distance` and `distance2` functions.

# Interpolation

Component-wise interpolation of quaternions does not generally yield good
results when the quaternions are interpreted as rotations.  The basic reason is
that rotations correspond to *unit* quaternions, but component-wise
interpolation does not respect this constraint.  There are two specialized
functions for dealing with this problem.  The first is [`slerp`](@ref), which
is an abbreviation of "Spherical Linear intERPolation", and is the direct
analog of standard linear interpolation of functions ‚Ñù ‚Üí ‚Ñù.  The second is
[`squad`](@ref), which is an abbreviation of "Spherical QUADrangle
interpolation", and is more analogous to cubic interpolation by B√©zier splines.
The first is relatively fast but has discontinuous first derivatives at the
input points, while the second is somewhat slower but has continuous first and
second derivatives.

In both cases, it is important for extraneous sign flips to be eliminated
before passing quaternions to the interpolating functions.  For this purpose,
there is the [`unflip`](@ref) utility function, which can also be called
automatically by passing the corresponding keywords to `slerp` and `squad`.
