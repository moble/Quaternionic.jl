*Quaternions for Julia*

## Installation
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("https://github.com/moble/Quaternionic.jl")
```

## Usage
See [the documentation](https://moble.github.io/Quaternionic.jl/dev) for details.

## Motivation
This is a simple project to build a quaternion type in Julia.  [The most
popular](https://github.com/JuliaGeometry/Quaternions.jl) quaternion package in Julia has made
certain design choices that conflict with my needs, and does not have many applications that I
consider to be fairly basic to a good quaternion package, including

  * Subtypes for rotors and pure-vector quaternions, with corresponding specialized methods
  * Numerous conversions to and from other representations of quaternions â€” especially rotations
  * Smooth interpolation, and differentation of the interpolant
  * Intelligent handling of distance measures
  * Construction of random quaternions of the various special types
  * Documentation
  * Thorough testing

I have plenty of experience programming quaternions (including [this popular python
package](https://github.com/moble/quaternion), and [this newer and fancier
package](https://github.com/moble/quaternionic)), though not much experience with Julia, so this
seems like a good first project.  In particular, I am interested in understanding how a general
geometric algebra would be coded, so I will be experimenting with subtypes and static arrays, even
though I can imagine that hard-coding the four components could be better in some ways.  Once I am
better at Julia, I may just rewrite that part, though hopefully in a way that will be invisible to
users.
